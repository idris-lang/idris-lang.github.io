Idris 2
-------

Idris 2 is still a work in progress, but documentation is growing, and
available from
`https://idris2.readthedocs.org <https://idris2.readthedocs.io/>`_.
This includes:

* A `crash course in Idris 2 <https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html>`_
* A list of `Changes since Idris 1 <https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/updates/updates.html>`_
* `Changes required <https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/typedd/typedd.html>`_
  to the code in `Type Driven Development with Idris <https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris>`_.

There is API documentation for the following packages:

* `prelude <https://www.idris-lang.org/Idris2/prelude>`__
* `base <https://www.idris-lang.org/Idris2/base>`__
* `contrib <https://www.idris-lang.org/Idris2/contrib>`__
