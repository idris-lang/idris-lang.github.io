Idris 2
-------

Idris 2 is still a work in progress, but documentation is growing, and
available from
`https://idris2.readthedocs.org <https://idris2.readthedocs.io/>`_.
This includes:

* A `crash course in Idris 2 <https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html>`_
* A list of `Changes since Idris 1 <https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/updates/updates.html>`_
* `Changes required <https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/typedd/typedd.html>`_
  to the code in `Type Driven Development with Idris <https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris>`_.

There is API documentation for the following packages:

* `prelude <https://www.idris-lang.org/Idris2/prelude>`__
* `base <https://www.idris-lang.org/Idris2/base>`__
* `contrib <https://www.idris-lang.org/Idris2/contrib>`__
* `linear <https://www.idris-lang.org/Idris2/linear>`__
* `network <https://www.idris-lang.org/Idris2/network>`__
* `test <https://www.idris-lang.org/Idris2/test>`__
* `papers <https://www.idris-lang.org/Idris2/papers>`__

You can also find our `Community Standards <{filename}./standards.rst>`_ here.


Idris 1 (DEPRECATED)
--------------------

**Idris 1 is deprecated. If you are still using Idris 1, we recommend switching
to Idris 2.** A list of differences is available
`in the documentation <https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/updates/updates.html>`_.

As such, documentation is no longer available through the website. If you still
require access to the Idris 1 documentation, the following Internet Archive
(aka. Wayback Machine) snapshots are available:

* `Idris 1 documentation <https://web.archive.org/web/20210413141523/http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/>`_
* `API documentation <https://web.archive.org/web/20210120133940/https://www.idris-lang.org/docs/current/>`_

Additionally, the
`old Idris 1 Wiki <https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki>`_
contains a lot of community supplied information.
