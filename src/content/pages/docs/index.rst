Idris 1 (DEPRECATED)
--------------------

**Idris 1 is deprecated. If you are still using Idris 1, we recommend switching
to Idris 2.** A list of differences is available
`in the documentation <https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/updates/updates.html>`_.

As such, documentation is no longer available through the website. If you still
require access to the Idris 1 documentation, the following Internet Archive
(aka. Wayback Machine) snapshots are available:

* `Idris 1 documentation <https://web.archive.org/web/20210413141523/http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/>`_
* `API documentation <https://web.archive.org/web/20210120133940/https://www.idris-lang.org/docs/current/>`_

Additionally, the
`old Idris 1 Wiki <https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki>`_
contains a lot of community supplied information.
